# Visit Management System for Equipment â€“ OCP Khouribga

This project is a **two-part solution** designed to optimize the management of equipment visits at **Laverie Daoui**, a partner of **OCP Khouribga**. The system ensures streamlined operations by providing a **mobile application** for field agents and a **desktop application** for administrators.

## Overview

### Mobile Application (Android Studio)
The mobile app empowers field agents with the following capabilities:
- **Scan Equipment QR Codes**: Easily identify equipment by scanning QR codes generated by the desktop app.
- **Validate Visits**: Confirm equipment visits as per the scheduled program (e.g., daily, weekly, bi-weekly).
- **Log Equipment Status**: After each visit, users can input a detailed description of the equipment's condition.
- **Daily Visit Schedule**: Automatically fetches and displays the scheduled visits for the day, ensuring no equipment is missed.

### Desktop Application (JavaFX)
The desktop app is designed for administrative and maintenance oversight:
- **Manage Equipment**: Add, edit, delete, and view equipment details in the database.
- **Generate QR Codes**: Create and print QR codes for equipment, enabling easy identification during mobile visits.
- **Monitor Visit Compliance**: Check if all scheduled visits were completed by mobile app users.
- **Review Equipment Status**: View descriptions logged by mobile app users to assess the condition of equipment.
- **Decision-Making**: Decide on necessary maintenance actions based on user-submitted equipment statuses.
